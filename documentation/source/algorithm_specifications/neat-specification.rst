NEAT Specification
==================

**[WORK IN PROGRESS]**

This page will cover:

* Link to original paper and authors
* video on specification details
* Official specifications as per paper and author
* etc


.. warning::  This specification outlines the NEAT algorithm & encoding as understood by the TFNE project. While the TFNE project aims to stay as close as possible to the original specification, does it also aim to be a superset of the configuration options of the original specification. This specification also concretizes the algorithm specification if the original specification is too vague and no code was supplied. If you find an issue with the specification or the implementation details please contact tfne@paulpauls.de. Thank you.
